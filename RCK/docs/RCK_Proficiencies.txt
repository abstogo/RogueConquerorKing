Proficiency implementation:

We'll be including proficiencies from Core and PC, plus some enhancements from HFH to make the game more playable. There will be some proficiencies which won't translate easily; we'll make a list and ask for suggestions as to how to use them. Some others will not have effect until after Release 1, since they affect mechanics that we won't be covering to start with.
