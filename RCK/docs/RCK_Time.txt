40ft / round

1 round = 10 seconds

1 turn = 60 rounds

1 turn of exercise every 5 turns

1 square = 5ft



Types of movement:
40 / 30 / 20 / 10
Squares per 10-second round:
8  /  6 /  4 /  2
Squares per second:
0.8 / 0.6 / 0.4 / 0.2

Seconds per square:
1.25 / 1.67 / 2.5 / 5

Each 1-square move pushes a number of ticks based on speed. 

Each (round-length) action pushes 10 ticks.

Each tick, everthing else updates its time and moves if it should

60 rounds in a turn
600 ticks in a turn
Therefore 

Base Fatigue: 3000
Every tick of action uses 1 Fatigue

Resting for 1 turn restores all Fatigue. Therefore resting for 1 tick restores 5 Fatigue.
