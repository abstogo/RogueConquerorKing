TAG MECHANICS

Various things in the game (stats, class levels, equipment, conditions, injuries, spells etc) can all grant abilities and bonuses to characters. These are handled using a system of Tags. Each character has a dictionary of Tags and currently set values that are calculated according to the following order:

1) Base Tags (same for all characters - include things like Capability:Move and other basic elements)
2) Statistic Tags (tags from stat bonuses/penalties)
3) Class Tags (tags from class levels)
4) Proficiency Tags (tags from proficiencies, including Adventuring)
5) Mortal Wound Tags (tags from Mortal Wound effects)
6) Tampering Tags (tags from Tampering With Mortality effects)
7) Condition Tags (tags from current Conditions applying to the character)
8) Equipment Tags (tags from any current Equipment applying to the character)
9) Status Tags (tags from current Status elements, including eg magical effects currently on the character)

Many tags use a colon ':' to indicate subcategories; this is strictly a visual thing. Tags are cumulative from any sources.

CAPABILITY TAGS: Controls whether a character can do the thing described. 

Capability Tags are usually either 0 or 1. Any capability with >0 is considered to be True (so for example if the character has "Capability:Magic"/1 and "Capability:Magic:Ritual"/1 then they have an effective Magic Ritual capability value of 2, which means they can use it. Similarly, if for some reason they cannot do Magic Research then they may have "Capability:Magic:Research"/-1, meaning their subcategory value is 0.
